# products-timeline-youtube v1.0
Idea of this project is to show player in screen. While the player is playing, products will appear at specified time relating to products shown in video. User can select desired products and proceed to checkout flow.


1. Youtube player plays a video
2. Products from an online store are shown at specified time of video e.g a video is playing, at 1:14 a camera is shown in video, attached product of camera which will be fetched from a store pops up
3. User can then see products at different time intervals of video and select and add to cart
4. User can then proceed to checkout flow

This is very basic and abstract implementation, it can be improved and scaled up.
